Problem 1
(a) int=42
(b) int=42
(c) This expression is not well typed because the elements in the array do not all have the same type.  1, 9, 4, and 2 are of type int while -3. is of type float.  An array expects all of its elements to be of the same type.
(d) int list=[2; 4; 6; 8; 10]
(e) (string * string) list=[("zar"), ("doz")]
(f) unit=()
(g) int option=Some 3110
(h) int=1764
(i) This expression is not well typed because the function f expects an int, but it perceives f f 10 as f(f,10) with both f and 10 being arguments.
(j) int=12

Problem 2
(a) 1
(b) ["hello world"]
(c) 

Problem 3
(* This method takes two lists and returns a list of their sorted values *)
let rec combine ((a: int list), (b: int list)) =
  match (a,b) with
    ([],[]) -> []
  | ([], b) -> b
  | (a, []) -> a
  | (a,b) -> if List.hd(a)<List.hd(b) then List.hd(a)::zardoz(List.tl(a),b)
             else List.hd(b)::zardoz(a,List.tl(b))
