Problem 1
(a) int=42
(b) int=42
(c) This expression is not well typed because the elements in the array do not all have the same type.  1, 9, 4, and 2 are of type int while -3. is of type float.  An array expects all of its elements to be of the same type.
(d) int list=[2; 4; 6; 8; 10]
(e) (string * string) list=[("zar"), ("doz")]
(f) unit=()
(g) int option=Some 3110
(h) int=1764
(i) This expression is not well typed because the function f expects an int, but it perceives f f 10 as f(f,10) with both f and 10 being arguments.
(j) int=12
